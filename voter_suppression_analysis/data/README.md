### Overview

The data used comes from two sources: the ACLU and US Census Bureau. Note that `/raw` contains data files directly downloaded from source, while `/clean` houses any generated or manually-reformatted versions of raw sheets. Specifically, the US Census Bureau data required major recorrection, as the structure was not conducive to any automated Python pipeline.
