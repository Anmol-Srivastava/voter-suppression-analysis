The "senate" and "district" sets have constituency-level Senate & House returns, respectively, that are official and complete.

The "state" and "county" sets have constituency-level state office and county office returns, respectively. 

The "precinct" set contains precinct-level election returns for all offices, and is incomplete but updated weekly. 

Variable codes are in the "codes" MD file. 


Apparent Distinctions:
    - States are divided into constituencies, where each of the 435 total constituencies elect 1 House member
    - Districts, seemingly, refer to "Congressional" districts (i.e., are the same as constituencies)
        - other types of districts exist, too, and this distinction must be clarified 
    - Counties are collections of areas within constituencies, but those districts do not have to follow county lines
    - Precincts are the smallest unit into which electoral districts are divided
        - each has 1 poll location for its residents, although a location may be common to multiple precincts  


Data Validity: 
    - Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, New York, South Dakota, and Utah are missing in the precinct data
    - DC has its own representation in the data, and New York data may be missing in multiple sets
    - Some data for Texas was pre-processed (see repository for details), other states also have minor erroneous issues
