The idea is to have two notably distinct data streams to clearly fulfill the requirements.
We combine data re: election results, and data re: demographics, to quantify the degree of voter suppression.
That degree (and other valuable analyses) will be projected onto a map visualization. 
Note that it is ideal for the two streams to be pulled from separate sources. 
Desired granularity is at congressional district level. 
The below references are all looking at (possibly different) elections in 2018 - some organizing required. 

*Election Results*
MIT Election Lab data is good for this section: many time periods and election types are recorded. 
Granularity may be an issue, we should select all data at highest available granularity for 2018.

*Demographics, Registration, Turnout*
Census data below; seemingly, turnout, eligible population, and demographics are included.

Better demographic data, also from Census: MUCH more detailed descriptions provided, but granularity is state-level. 
Should be included due to highly-valuable attributes like "method of voting" - granularity can be compromised in final deliverable.
